ABSTRACT = {News currently spreads rapidly through the internet. Because fake news stories are designed to attract readers, they tend to spread faster. For most readers, detecting fake news can be challenging and such readers usually end up believing that the fake news story is fact. Because fake news can be socially problematic, a model that automatically detects such fake news is required. In this paper, we focus on data-driven automatic fake news detection methods. We first apply the Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers model (BERT) model to detect fake news by analyzing the relationship between the headline and the body text of news. To further improve performance, additional news data are gathered and used to pre-train this model. We determine that the deep-contextualizing nature of BERT is best suited for this task and improves the 0.14 F-score over older state-of-the-art models.},

abstract = {Fake News has been a concern all over the world and social media has only amplified this phenomenon. Fake News has been affecting the world on a large scale as these are targeted to sway the decisions of the crowd in a particular direction. Since manually verifying the legitimacy of news is very hard and costly, there has been a great interest of researchers in this field. Different approaches to identifying fake news were examined, such as content-based classification, social context-based classification, image-based classification, sentiment-based classification, and hybrid context-based classification. This paper aims to propose a model for fake news classification based on news titles, following the content-based classification approach. The model uses a BERT model with its outputs connected to an LSTM layer. Training and evaluation of the model were done on the FakeNewsNet dataset which contains two sub-datasets, PolitiFact and GossipCop. A comparison of the model with base classification models has been done. A vanilla BERT model has also been trained on the dataset under similar constraints as the proposed model has to evaluate the impact same using an LSTM layer. The results obtained showed a 2.50\% and 1.10\% increase in accuracy on PolitiFact and GossipCop datasets respectively over the vanilla pre-trained BERT model.}

abstract = {The proliferation of fake news and its propagation on social media has become a major concern due to its ability to create devastating impacts. Different machine learning approaches have been suggested to detect fake news. However, most of those focused on a specific type of news (such as political) which leads us to the question of dataset-bias of the models used. In this research, we conducted a benchmark study to assess the performance of different applicable machine learning approaches on three different datasets where we accumulated the largest and most diversified one. We explored a number of advanced pre-trained language models for fake news detection along with the traditional and deep learning ones and compared their performances from different aspects for the first time to the best of our knowledge. We find that BERT and similar pre-trained models perform the best for fake news detection, especially with very small dataset. Hence, these models are significantly better option for languages with limited electronic contents, i.e., training data. We also carried out several analysis based on the models’ performance, article’s topic, article’s length, and discussed different lessons learned from them. We believe that this benchmark study will help the research community to explore further and news sites/blogs to select the most appropriate fake news detection method.}

Experiments show that while media fact-checking remains to be an open research question, stylistic cues can help determine the truthfulness of text.",

We collected a decade-long, 12.8K manually labeled short statements in various contexts from PolitiFact.com, which provides detailed analysis report and links to source documents for each case. This dataset can be used for fact-checking research as well. Notably, this new dataset is an order of magnitude larger than previously largest public fake news datasets of similar type. Empirically, we investigate automatic fake news detection based on surface-level linguistic patterns. We have designed a novel, hybrid convolutional neural network to integrate meta-data with text. We show that this hybrid approach can improve a text-only deep learning model.",

abstract = {Social media for news consumption is a double-edged sword. On the one hand, its low cost, easy access, and rapid dissemination of information lead people to seek out and consume news from social media. On the other hand, it enables the wide spread of fake news", i.e., low quality news with intentionally false information. The extensive spread of fake news has the potential for extremely negative impacts on individuals and society. Therefore, fake news detection on social media has recently become an emerging research that is attracting tremendous attention. Fake news detection on social media presents unique characteristics and challenges that make existing detection algorithms from traditional news media ine ective or not applicable. First, fake news is intentionally written to mislead readers to believe false information, which makes it difficult and nontrivial to detect based on news content; therefore, we need to include auxiliary information, such as user social engagements on social media, to help make a determination. Second, exploiting this auxiliary information is challenging in and of itself as users' social engagements with fake news produce data that is big, incomplete, unstructured, and noisy. Because the issue of fake news detection on social media is both challenging and relevant, we conducted this survey to further facilitate research on the problem. In this survey, we present a comprehensive review of detecting fake news on social media, including fake news characterizations on psychology and social theories, existing algorithms from a data mining perspective, evaluation metrics and representative datasets. We also discuss related research areas, open problems, and future research directions for fake news detection on social media.},

abstract = {ABSTRACT This research surveys the current state-of-the-art technologies that are instrumental in the adoption and development of fake news detection. “Fake news detection” is defined as the task of categorizing news along a continuum of veracity, with an associated measure of certainty. Veracity is compromised by the occurrence of intentional deceptions. The nature of online news publication has changed, such that traditional fact checking and vetting from potential deception is impossible against the flood arising from content generators, as well as various formats and genres. The paper provides a typology of several varieties of veracity assessment methods emerging from two major categories – linguistic cue approaches (with machine learning), and network analysis approaches. We see promise in an innovative hybrid approach that combines linguistic cue and machine learning, with network-based behavioral data. Although designing a fake news detector is not a straightforward problem, we propose operational guidelines for a feasible fake news detecting system.},
