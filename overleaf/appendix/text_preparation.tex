I conducted an exploration and preprocessing of textual data, dividing it into a training set and a test set. I examined basic descriptive statistics regarding the length of the news articles. The average text length is approximately 80. Less than 25\% of the texts are longer than 100. This is significant because the maximum text length that can be used as input for BERT is 512. Therefore, text lengths should not pose a problem. In the case of texts longer than 512, they are truncated to a length of 512, and the remaining words are disregarded. It is also worth noting that the training set and the test set exhibit very similar statistics.

\makegapedcells
\begin{tabular}{l|ll}
Statistics & Train set & Test set \\ \hline
Count & 11524 & 1267 \\ 
Mean  & 81   & 83  \\ 
Std   & 47    & 83   \\
Min   & 8    & 9   \\
25\%  & 56    & 57   \\
50\%  & 75    & 75   \\
75\%  & 100   & 99  \\
Max   & 2711  & 2560
\end{tabular}
}

\end{table}

Before merging multiple classes into two classes (for fake news and true news), I examined the cardinality of each individual class in order to combine them in a manner that would create a balanced binary class.

\begin{table}[!htbp]
\centering
{
\makegapedcells
\begin{tabular}{l|ll}
Class & Size \\ \hline
half-true   & 2362 \\
false       & 2258 \\
mostly-true & 2213 \\
barely-true & 1891 \\
true        & 1845 \\
pants-fire  & 955 
\end{tabular}
}
\caption{Class size before combining into two classes}
\label{class_size}
\end{table}

After the merger, the balance of both classes is represented as follows. The dataset balance is highly similar between the training and testing sets.

\end{figure}


The prepared dataset was examined with regard to the most common words. The analysis was divided based on the training and testing sets, as well as the type of news, whether it is a fake news or genuine. The analysis of the following charts allows us to conclude that no distinct pattern of the most popular words stands out among the identified groups, which could disrupt the study.
